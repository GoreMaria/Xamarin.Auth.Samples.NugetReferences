# Xamarin.Auth

Xamarin.Auth is a cross platform library that helps developers authenticate 
users via OAuth protocol (OAuth1 and OAuth2). 

OAuth flow (process) is setup in 5 major steps:

1.	Initialization of Authenticator object		
	preparing all relevant OAuth Data in Authenticator object
2.	Creating and optionally customising UI		
3.	Lunching UI and authenticating user
4.	Detecting/Fetching/Intercepting URL change - redirect url 	
	and 	
	parsing	OAuth data from redirect_url
5.	Triggering Events based on OAuth data 

Those steps and (substeps) which will be used in detailed documentation 
[./Details.md](./Details.md) and WalkThorugh docs for both Android and
iOS.


## 1. Initialization

Those steps will be 

### 1.1. Create and configure an authenticator

Let's authenticate a user to access Facebook:

```csharp
using Xamarin.Auth;
// ...
var auth = new OAuth2Authenticator 
    (
        clientId: "App ID from https://developers.facebook.com/apps",
        scope: "",
        authorizeUrl: new Uri ("https://m.facebook.com/dialog/oauth/"),
        redirectUrl: new Uri ("http://www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html"),
        // switch for new Native UI API
        //      true = Android Custom Tabs and/or iOS Safari View Controller
        //      false = Embedded Browsers used (Android WebView, iOS UIWebView)
        //  default = false  (not using NEW native UI)
        isUsingNativeUI: use_native_ui
    );
```

Facebook uses OAuth 2.0 authentication, so we create an `OAuth2Authenticator`. 
Authenticators are responsible for managing the user interface and communicating with 
authentication services.

Authenticators take a variety of parameters; in this case, the application's ID, its 
authorization scope, and Facebook's various service locations are required.

### 1.2. Setup Authentication Event Handlers

To capture events and information in the OAuth flow simply subscribe to Authenticator
events (add event handlers):

Xamarin.Android

```csharp
auth.Completed += (sender, eventArgs) => 
{
    // UI presented, so it's up to us to dimiss it on Android
    // dismiss Activity with WebView or CustomTabs
    this.Finish();

    if (eventArgs.IsAuthenticated) 
    {
        // Use eventArgs.Account to do wonderful things
    } else 
    {
        // The user cancelled
    }
};
```

Xamarin.iOS

```csharp
auth.Completed += (sender, eventArgs) => 
{
    // UI presented, so it's up to us to dimiss it on iOS
    // dismiss ViewController with UIWebView or SFSafariViewController
    this.DismissViewController (true, null);

    if (eventArgs.IsAuthenticated) 
    {
        // Use eventArgs.Account to do wonderful things
    } else 
    {
        // The user cancelled
    }
};
```

## 2. Authenticate the user

While authenticators manage their own UI, it's up to you to initially present the 
authenticator's UI on the screen. This lets you control how the authentication UI is 
displayed–modally, in navigation controllers, in popovers, etc.

Before we present the UI, we need to start listening to the `Completed` event which fires 
when the user successfully authenticates or cancels. You can find out if the authentication 
succeeded by testing the `IsAuthenticated` property of `eventArgs`:


All the information gathered from a successful authentication is available in 
`eventArgs.Account`.

Now we're ready to present the login UI 

The `GetUI` method used to return ("old" - Embedded Browser API)

*   `UINavigationControllers` on iOS, and 
*   `Intents` on Android.  

for new API (both Embedded Browsers and Native UI Support) user will need to
cast object to appropriate type:

*   Android     
    *   Embedded Browser WebView - cast to `Intent`     
    *   native UI - cast to CustomTabsIntent.Builder and call Build() to et Intent  
*   iOS     
    *   Embedded Browser UIWebView - cast to `UIViewController`     
    *   native UI - cast to `SFSafariViewController`    
    
On Android, user would write the following code to present the UI.

instead of

```csharp
StartActivity (auth.GetUI (this));
```

use 

```csharp
StartActivity ((Intent)auth.GetUI (this));
```

and for Native UI (Custom Tabs):

```csharp
StartActivity (((CustomTabsIntent.Builder)auth.GetUI).Build() (this));
```

On iOS, user would present UI in following way (with differences fromold API)

Instead:

```csharp
PresentViewController (auth.GetUI (this));
```

for old API just cast object obtanied by GetUI() to `UIViewController`:

```csharp
PresentViewController ((UIViewController)auth.GetUI (this));
```

and for new API cast it to `SFSafariViewController`:
```csharp
PresentViewController ((SFSafariViewController)auth.GetUI (), true, null);
```


## 3. Making requests

Since Facebook is an OAuth2 service, we'll make requests with `OAuth2Request` providing 
the account we retrieved from the `Completed` event. Assuming we're authenticated, we'll 
grab the user's info to demonstrate:

```csharp
var request = new OAuth2Request 
                    (
                        "GET",
                         new Uri ("https://graph.facebook.com/me"), 
                         null, 
                         eventArgs.Account
                    );
request.GetResponseAsync().ContinueWith 
    (
        t => 
        {
            if (t.IsFaulted)
                Console.WriteLine ("Error: " + t.Exception.InnerException.Message);
            else 
            {
                string json = t.Result.GetResponseText();
                Console.WriteLine (json);
            }
        }
    );
```


## 4. Store the account

Xamarin.Auth securely stores `Account` objects so that you don't always have to reauthenticate 
the user. The `AccountStore` class is responsible for storing `Account` information, backed by 
the 
[Keychain](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/security/Reference/keychainservices/Reference/reference.html) 
on iOS and a [KeyStore](http://developer.android.com/reference/java/security/KeyStore.html) on 
Android:

```csharp
// On iOS:
AccountStore.Create ().Save (eventArgs.Account, "Facebook");

// On Android:
AccountStore.Create (this).Save (eventArgs.Account, "Facebook");
```

Saved Accounts are uniquely identified using a key composed of the account's 
`Username` property and a "Service ID". The "Service ID" is any string that is 
used when fetching accounts from the store.

If an `Account` was previously saved, calling `Save` again will overwrite it. 
This is convenient for services that expire the credentials stored in the account 
object.


## 5. Retrieve stored accounts

You can fetch all `Account` objects stored for a given service:

```csharp
// On iOS:
IEnumerable<Account> accounts = AccountStore.Create ().FindAccountsForService ("Facebook");

// On Android:
IEnumerable<Account> accounts = AccountStore.Create (this).FindAccountsForService ("Facebook");
```

It's that easy.


## 6. Make your own authenticator

Xamarin.Auth includes OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 2.0 authenticators, providing support for thousands 
of popular services. For services that use traditional username/password authentication, you 
can roll your own authenticator by deriving from `FormAuthenticator`.

If you want to authenticate against an ostensibly unsupported service, fear not – Xamarin.Auth 
is extensible! It's very easy to create your own authenticators – just derive from any of the 
existing authenticators and start overriding methods.
